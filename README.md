# Refining the assumptions of the MetaboliteDetector retention index score

The code in this repository supports >insert publication<. Here, you'll find 3 main folders: 

**Markdowns:** Contains all the plots and analysis summaries from the publication. It is split into 4 markdowns, one for each figure in the publication. Supplemental figures can be found throughout the markdowns. 

**RI Specific Data:** Houses the results of the 10% holdout analyses for both the full and subset datasets. Other files, such as retention time information for FAMES files, are kept here as well. 

**Scripts:** Holds the scripts for the 10% holdout analyses as well as the assumption violation simulations (for Figure 2)
